 # Rust for TypeScript Devs 
 ## 100 Projects in 100 Days
 
It tried learning rust by reading [Zero To Production](https://www.zero2prod.com) by Luca Palmieri.
 
It's written for people who have finished reading ["the book"](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) and want to start applying everything to something a bit more meaty.
 
Here's an excerpt:
 
> "Choose a problem you want to solve.*
> 
> *Let the problem drive the introduction of new concepts and techniques.*
> 
> *It flips the hierarchy you are used to: the material you are studying is not relevant because somebody claims it is, it is relevant because it is useful to get closer to a solution.*
> 
> You learn new techniques and when it makes sense to reach for them."*
 
The book focuses on how to build an email newsletter from scratch. Specifically goes through the challenges of writing cloud-native applications in a team of four or five engineers with different levels of experience and proficiency.
 
I love like this problem-based approach to learning. 
 
The only problem is, at the moment, I'm struggling to find the time. I keep starting and stopping the zero book. I would much prefer to sit down with it for a week and finish the whole thing in one continuous sprint. Since that cannot happen right now, I've resorted to build something super simple each day to keep things from stalling.
 
The key is that each build is basic enough that I can finish it in about 20 minutes. This way, I can make progress with the time I realistically have and continue to cross off concepts on the [Rust roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/rust) each day.
  
I found this wicked [Rust Bootcamp on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/rust-programming-bootcamp) by Vivian Aranha that involves building 100 rust projects.

Sadly, he only made 12 videos and then gave up. The remaining 78 projects are just text files. I thought I could pick up where he left off and try finishing the remaining explainer videos. Since I come from a typescript background, the majority of my understanding will come from translating typescript concepts over.
