This is a sample text file for testing the word counter program.
It contains multiple sentences with various words to demonstrate the functionality.

The word counter should be able to count all the words in this file,
including words separated by spaces, newlines, and other whitespace characters.

This file has enough content to make the word counting meaningful and interesting.
You can modify this text or create your own files to test different scenarios.

Happy coding with Rust!
